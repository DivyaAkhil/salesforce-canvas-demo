<div>
Hello, I'm a web app written in Node.js embedded in your Salesforce page.
I'm aware of my environment. For example, I know who you are (<strong><%= user.fullName %></strong>), the object this page is showing (<strong><%= environment.record.attributes.type %></strong>), and its Id (<strong><%= environment.record.attributes.Id %></strong>).
With that information I can run contextual queries and show useful information.
So it's easy for you to integrate external apps in you Salesforce environement.
