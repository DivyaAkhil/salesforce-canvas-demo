    <p>Hello, . This is a web app written in Node.js embedded in your Salesforce page (It could be written in any other language).</p>
    It's aware of the environment it's running in. For example, here are a few things it knows:
    <p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>User:</td><td>aaa</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Object:</td><td>aaa</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Id:</td><td>aaa</td></tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    With that information, it's easy to integrate contextual applications written in any language inside your Salesforce pages.
